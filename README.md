**Verilog HDL project implementing a 4-bit Array Multiplier for digital arithmetic applications.**  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project demonstrates the design of a **4-bit Array Multiplier** using Verilog HDL.  
The multiplier is built by generating partial products and combining them using **Half Adders (HA)** and **Full Adders (FA)** in an array structure.  
The result is an **8-bit product output**.

## ðŸ”¹ Features  
- Implements **4-bit Ã— 4-bit multiplication**  
- Designed using **structural Verilog**  
- Includes reusable modules: `FA` (Full Adder) and `HFA` (Half Adder)  
- Synthesizable and FPGA-ready  
- Modular and well-commented code  

---

## ðŸ”¹ File Structure  
- `multiplier.v` â†’ Main 4-bit Array Multiplier module with FA and HFA submodules  
- `multiplier_tb.v` â†’ Testbench for functional verification (to be added)  
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation

## ðŸ”¹ Working Principle  
1. **Partial products** are generated by ANDing input bits.  
2. Partial products are arranged in a structured array.  
3. **Half Adders** and **Full Adders** are used to add the partial products.  
4. The final result is an **8-bit product (`P`)**.
